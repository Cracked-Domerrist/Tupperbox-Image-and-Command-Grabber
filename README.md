# Tupperbox Image and Command Grabber

This repository contains two programs: Tupperbox Image Grabber and Tupperbox Command Grabber. These programs provide simple functionalities for working with Tupperbox profiles.

## Tupper Image Grabber

The Tupperbox Image Grabber program allows you to download images associated with a Tupperbox profile using the provided JSON file.

## Tupper Registry Command Grabber

The Tupperbox Command Grabber program reverses the process of a Tupperbox registry, converting it back to its normal form of `tul!register "NAME" BRACKETS!text"` and `tul!nick "OLD NAME" "DISPLAY NAME"`.

## Installation

1. Download the Tupperbox JSON file by running the Discord command `tul!export` and downloading the message from your DMs.
2. Place the JSON file in the same directory as the respective program's executable.
3. Run the executable file.
4. When prompted, enter the name of the JSON file with the extension.
